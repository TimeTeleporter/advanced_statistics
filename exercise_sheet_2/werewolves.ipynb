    "## Exercise 1: The Werewolves of Millers Hollow\n",
    "\n",
    "Millers Hollow (pop. 842) is haunted by werewolves killing villagers at night. It is estimated that they currently represent 10% of the entire population. As an established statistician, the Council asks for your help in order to devise strategies to identify werewolves and bring Millers Hollow back to peace and tranquility. The Council worked relentlessly in the past year to build a werewolf detector, which samples a tiny bit of blood from each individual submitted to the test. They are very proud of it as this detector has an accuracy of 90% in detecting werewolves from gentle villagers. The Council claims that they would then be able to imprison 90% of the individuals who failed the test. Demonstrate that the Councilâ€™s approach is too optimistic. If one villager fails the test, what is the probability that they are a werewolf?"
