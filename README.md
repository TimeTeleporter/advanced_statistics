# Advanced Statistic Methods in Physics

This repository hosts my solved exercises and exam preparations. Here I will give an overview over the files and exercises and where to find different topics

## Topics

The corresponding exercise sheets is given in the brakets.

- Bayesian inference (2, 3)
- Simulating data (3)
- Linear models (4, 5)
- Categorical varaiables (5)
- Comparing models (5)

## Exercise sheet 2

This discusses Bayesian inference.

## Exercise sheet 3

In these exercises we continue the discussion of Bayesian inference and then simulate an experiment (globe tossing).

## Exercise sheet 4

This sheet concerns itself with linear models, sampling the posterior distribution, comparing models, log scales.

## Exercise sheet 5

Introducing categorical variables to the linear models, building and comparing models
