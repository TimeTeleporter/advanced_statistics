# Advanced Statistic Methods in Physics

This repository hosts my solved exercises and exam preparations. Here I will give an overview over the files and exercises and where to find different topics

## Topics

The corresponding exercise sheets is given in the brakets.

- Bayesian inference (2, 3)
- Simulating data (3, 5)
- Linear models (4, 5)
- Categorical varaiables (5, 7, 9)
- Comparing models (5, 6, 7)
- Multivariate models (6, 7, 9)
- Multicollinearity (6)

## Exercise sheet 2

This discusses Bayesian inference.

## Exercise sheet 3

In these exercises we continue the discussion of Bayesian inference and then simulate an experiment (globe tossing).

## Exercise sheet 4

This sheet concerns itself with linear models, sampling the posterior distribution, comparing models, log scales.

## Exercise sheet 5

Introducing categorical variables to the linear models, building and comparing models, and simulating experiments.

## Exercise sheet 6

In this exercise we look at multivariate models for the first time with the example of the red foxes data set. We build different models and compare them, including different predictors. We encounter multicollinearity when including interdependent predictors such as the average food per area and the size of the area.

## Exercise sheet 7

We continue constructing multivariate models, this time looking at primates, where we investigate the size of the neocortex in dependence of the energy content of their milk. We look at different clades and use categorical variable to discuss the differences there.

## Exercise sheet 8

This exercise introduces the notion of training and testing datasets. Using the Watanabeâ€“Akaike information criterion we compare the models, adding it to our toolbox.

## Exercise sheet 9

In this exercise sheet we continue our discussion of categorical variables, where we now look at them in multivaraiate models. We look at the example of wine tasting.
